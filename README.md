# Fake-News-Detection-and-Abstractive-Summarization
#This project leverages state-of-the-art Transformer-based NLP models to address two critical tasks in the field of media integrity and content understanding:

#Fake News Detection (BERT-based)-
I use BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for binary classification of news articles as fake or real. The model is fine-tuned on labeled news datasets, capturing contextual language nuances for highly accurate predictions.

#Explainability with LIME-
To promote transparency and trust, we apply LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to interpret and visualize the model’s decision, helping users understand why a particular article was classified as fake or real.

#Abstractive Text Summarization (T5-based)-
For summarization, i implement T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) — a powerful encoder-decoder model capable of generating human-like abstractive summaries from long-form news content.

#Features:
Fine-tuned BERT model for fake news classification in Hindi
LIME-based model interpretation for transparency
T5-based abstractive summarizer with high-quality results
Clean and modular code with notebook-based demos
Visual plots for insights and evaluation
Hindi text support using nltk and tokenization tools

#GUI: for the Graphics User Interface i have use Stream-Lit.

#Use Cases:
Regional media fact-checking tools
Explainable AI for content moderation platforms
Summarization engine for Hindi news apps or portals
